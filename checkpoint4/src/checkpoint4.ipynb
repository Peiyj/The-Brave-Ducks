        "**Overview:** With the following exploration of the Chicago Polic Database, we inspect co-offending officers and if they have any interesting relationships within each pair of officers. The exploration of the following questions is done via graph analytics, conducted using Apache Spark and GraphX tools, processed in the attached Google Colab notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Questions we seek to answer with the graph analytics:**\n",
        "1.   Are there occurrences of co-offending officers on the same misconduct report and how often do the same co-offending officers repeat?\n",
        "2.   What is the salary, rank, and race relationship between the topmost pair of co-offending officers? This analysis can then be repeated for each pair, as needed. For this report, we will provide discussion for the topmost offending pair.\n",
        "    *   do the officers have comparable salaries within 10% of each other?\n",
        "    *   are the officers of similar ranking or is one a higher ranking officer, possibly socially pressuring a lower ranking officer into committing misconduct?\n",
        "    *   are the officers the same race?\n",
        "3.   How many unique co-offending relationships does each officer have? It is straightforward to compute total misconduct of an individual officer but will be more meaningful to understanding how many unique relationships an officer has in which he/she allegedly commits a misconduct.\n",
        "    *   we will use the Triangle Count algorithm to count the unique relationships connecting officer_id nodes\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   Who is the ring-leader (most important) co-offending officer?\n",

We do a sanity-check on the computation by printing out the noted officer id '32356' as being the officer with the most unique co-offending relationships, being officer Vincent Stinar. We note that the TC algorithm computes he has 1514 unique co-offending relationships but the following computation for officer Stinar's total misconduct count is much lower, at total count equal to 12. This does not make intuitive sense for officer Vincent Stinar to have 1514 unique co-offending relationships but only 12 counts of misconduct. Upon further investigation and debugging of the code, we are unable to identify any specific bug in the code to rectify this error."
