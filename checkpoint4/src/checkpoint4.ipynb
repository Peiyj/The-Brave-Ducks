        "**Overview:** With the following exploration of the Chicago Polic Database, we inspect co-offending officers and if they have any interesting relationships within each pair of officers. The exploration of the following questions is done via graph analytics, conducted using Apache Spark and GraphX tools, processed in the attached Google Colab notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Questions we seek to answer with the graph analytics:**\n",
        "1.   Are there occurrences of co-offending officers on the same misconduct report and how often do the same co-offending officers repeat?\n",
        "2.   What is the salary, rank, and race relationship between the topmost pair of co-offending officers? This analysis can then be repeated for each pair, as needed. For this report, we will provide discussion for the topmost offending pair.\n",
        "    *   do the officers have comparable salaries within 10% of each other?\n",
        "    *   are the officers of similar ranking or is one a higher ranking officer, possibly socially pressuring a lower ranking officer into committing misconduct?\n",
        "    *   are the officers the same race?\n",
        "3.   How many unique co-offending relationships does each officer have? It is straightforward to compute total misconduct of an individual officer but will be more meaningful to understanding how many unique relationships an officer has in which he/she allegedly commits a misconduct.\n",
        "    *   we will use the Triangle Count algorithm to count the unique relationships connecting officer_id nodes\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   Who is the ring-leader (most important) co-offending officer?\n",

And although we understood the Triangle Count algorithm to compute the unique relationship each officer has, as described above, the computation result we get from the code does not make immediate intuitive sense. We do a sanity-check on the computation by printing out the noted officer id '32356' as being the officer with the most unique co-offending relationships, being officer Vincent Stinar. We note that the TC algorithm computes he has 1514 unique co-offending relationships but the following computation for officer Stinar's total misconduct count is much lower, at total count equal to 12. This does not make intuitive sense for officer Vincent Stinar to have 1514 unique co-offending relationships but only 12 counts of misconduct. Upon further investigation and debugging of the code, we are unable to identify any specific bug in the code to rectify this error.\n",

        "**[Edit]:** We previously noted that officer_id 32356, Officer Vincent Stinar, has the greatest number of co-offending relationships as analyzed by the trianglecount algorithm. It was also noted that these are unique co-offending triangular relationships and that it did not make intuitive sense to have such a large trianglecount result, 1514, while having only 12 total counts of misconduct allegations. After further review of the Triangle Count algorithm, we find that the analysis is not of *unique* co-offending relationships, but repeated count of relationships. This would then mean it is reasonable to see a larger triangle count result even if the total misconduct count is much lower."

Other officers may commit additional misconduct offenses separately as individuals and thereby increasing their overall misconduct count. \n",
